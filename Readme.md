# What this script does 

This script is specifically written for the half-automatic pipe bending machine at the Bauhaus University Metal workshop. You can upload polylines from most 3D programs and convert them into a table which can be used in the bending program in the workshop. This script also visualizes the bending radius for the specific pipe diameters (Always 1.5\*diameter).

# How to use the Script

 1. Export a single polyline as '.dxf'. (In Rhinoceros, select line, type '_Export'. If you would like to bend serveral pipes, treat them separately)
 2. Go to https://app.shapediver.com/m/biegemaschine-v3-3.
 3. Upload '.dxf' via 'Import .dxf'
 4. Ignore 'closed loop' (At least for now)
 5. Insert your pipe diameter under 'a'
 6. Check your 3D Model in the viewport.
 7. Input your E-Mail
 8. Hit 'Send Mail'
 9. Download '.csv' via link in Mail
10. copy values to bending program in the Metalle.
11. Bend on!
